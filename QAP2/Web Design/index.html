            The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the
            birth of the abacus. When the beads on the abacus are moved around,
            according to programming rules memorized by the user, all regular
            arithmetic problems can be done. In 1671, Gottfried Wilhelm von
            Leibniz invented a computer that was built in 1694. It could add,
            and, after changing some things around, multiply. About a century
            later Thomas of Colmar created the first successful mechanical
            calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

              realized that many long calculations were really a series of
              predictable actions that were constantly repeated. He began to
              design an automatic mechanical calculating machine, which he
              called a difference engine.

              Herman Hollerith and James Powers made a step towards automated
              computing with the development of punched cards. Reading errors
              were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of
              punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size.
              For more than 50 years, punched card machines did most of the
              world's first business computing.

              decided to build a high - speed electronic computer to do the job.
              Known as ENIAC, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate
              of 300 per second

              Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed
              the image of the computer field - Magnetic Core Memory and
              Transistor - Circuit Elements. These technical discoveries quickly
              found their way into computers. Such computers were mostly found
              in large computer centers operated by industry, government, and
              private laboratories.

              In the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest possible
              computer with the greatest capacity reached a turning point with
              the Stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with the fastest
              access time, and total capacity in the vicinity of 100,000,000
              words.

              Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced
              programmable minicomputers supplied with software packages in the
              1970’s. The "shrinking" trend continued with the introduction of
              personal computers (PC's), which are programmable machines small
              enough and inexpensive enough to be purchased and used by
              individuals. Many companies, such as Apple Computer and Radio
              Shack introduced very successful PCs in the 1970's.

              publishing are just a few of the applications that have grown in
              recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price, offering
              the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes,
              offices, and schools”.

        For my personal CSS touch I did two things. One, I used a linear
        gradiant in the header boxes. I wanted to spruce them up in a different
        way! I also outlined the text inside of them by styling the headers with
        webkit text stroke. I wanted the text to pop a little more inside of the
        boxes i assigned to them.
